PROJECT IDEA: A platform where students trade skills, not money.


---


CONCEPT

Students have different skills:

Coding

Drawing

Hair styling

Cooking

Notes summarizing

Music production

Video editing

Mathematics tutoring

CV writing

Networking assistance

Repairing phones or laptops


But they rarely know who can help them and they can’t always pay.

This system allows students to:

Offer their skills

Request skills from others

Make “skill trades” (e.g. “You design my poster, I help you with calculus”)

Rate each other after the exchange

1. Problem Being Solved

In campus settings, students often need assistance with academic tasks, personal skills, or small services.
However:

They don’t know who in campus can help.

They often can’t afford professional services.

Talent within the student community remains hidden.

There is no platform for exchanging skills instead of money.


This project solves the problem by creating a community-based skill exchange system, enabling students to trade skills easily and fairly.
